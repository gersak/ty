   ⚠️ MIGRATION NOTICE ⚠️
   
   This file has been CONSOLIDATED into ty.css
   
   Previous setup (deprecated):
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ty.variables.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ty.utilities.css">
   
   New setup (current):
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ty.css">
   
   Benefits of the new consolidated approach:
   ✅ Reduced HTTP requests (1 instead of 2)
   ✅ Simpler HTML (1 link instead of 2)  
   ✅ Atomic loading (variables and utilities always in sync)
   ✅ Easier distribution (single file)
   ✅ Same functionality, better performance
   
   This file can be safely deleted after migration.
